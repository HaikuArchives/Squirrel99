In Logo everything is a procedure call.  A procedure is either a
command, which has an effect, or an operation, which returns a value.
So basically the syntax is

<instruction> ::= <command-name> <expression>* |
		  ( <command-name> <expression>* )

<expression>  ::= <operation-name> <expression>* |
		  <list> | <quoted-word> | <number> |
		  <variable-ref> | ( <expression> )

<list>	      ::= [ <list-element>* ]

<quoted-word> ::= " <word>

<list-element>::= <list> | <word>

<word>	      ::= <string of characters other than space or [ or ]>

<variable-ref>::= : <word>

except that there is also infix arithmetic with + - * / = < > in the
usual way.  Wherever it says <expression>* the number of expressions
must match what the called procedure expects.

But different dialects differ about the precise rules for tokenization,
so the description of <word> above is a lie.  I'm afraid I know of no
published bnf, even for specific dialects.

Logo does have one special form, TO, which is used to define
procedures.

You might want to look at
	ftp://anarres.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/ucblogo/usermanual
for the Berkeley Logo reference manual, which gives examples.
