\section{Exec}

This Add-on allows us to execute external programs and to collect their output.

\subsection*{exec.bg} \index{\verb+exec.bg+}

{\tt exec.bg}  {\it word \verb?|? [word things...] string (thing)*}
\newline\newline
Execute the program given as the second input. All the inputs to the primitive after the second, will be given as arguments to the program. The first input is
the name of a function to execute each time the program outputs a line. The output will be given as the first input of the command. If a list is used instead of a word, it will contain as its first element, the name and inputs of the function to call. The primitive outputs the id of the thread.
\begin{verbatimtab}
to process :line
	print :line	
end

@> exec.bg "process '/bin/ls'
\end{verbatimtab}

\subsection*{exec.wait} \index{\verb+exec.wait+}

{\tt exec.wait} {\it word string (thing)*}
\newline\newline
Execute a program given as the second input. All the inputs to the primitive after the second, will be given as arguments to the program. The first input is
a variable name. This variable will contain a list of all the outputs from the program. The primitive returns when the program has finished and output the error code returned by the programmed executed.
\begin{verbatimtab}
@> exec.wait "term '/bin/sh' '-c' 'exec echo $TERM' 
@> print :term
dumb
\end{verbatimtab}

\subsection*{launch} \index{\verb+launch+}

{\tt launch} {\it string}
\newline\newline
Launch the preferred application of the file given as input (complete path).
\begin{verbatimtab}
@> launch 'mydoc.html'
\end{verbatimtab}
