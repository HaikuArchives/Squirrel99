<p>
Lost in my code, I didn't realize until after the last release than <i>Squirrel</i> was not all that easy to get started with, The <i>Developer's Guide</i> was not entirely clear. After receiving some feedback from brave and confused users, I decided to write a short document, in the opes to clarify key points and help people get started in the language <i>Squirrel</i>.

<b>1. The <i>Squirrel</i> distribution</b>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
You have just installed <i>Squirrel</i> in your <font color=blue>B</font><font color=red>e</font>OS computer and you anxious to try it, but you don't know how to start...<p>
The best things to do, is to try out the various demos available with the <i>Squirrel</i> distribution. <i>Squirrel</i> is installed in <tt>/boot/apps/Squirrel</tt>. You will find all the files in this directory, but the Add-Ons are located in <tt>/boot/home/config/add-ons/Squirrel</tt>. You will not be interacting with those files directly, so you may ignore them for the moment.
<p>
The distribution directory look like :<p>

<center>
<img src="./images/distri.gif" width=326 height=391 alt="distri">
</center>
<p>

You're encouraged to read the <i>ReadMe</i> file which contains useful informations about the release. As well, reading the <i>Developer's Guide</i> is a mandatory step for a serious start in <i>Squirrel</i>. You will find an HTML version in the <i>Developer's Guide</i> directory as well as a PDF version: <i> Developer's Guide.pdf</i>. If you going to play with <i>Skippy</i> you may read the <i>Skippy's User Manual.pdf</i>.<p>

The folder <i>GUI Tutorial</i> contains two articles published in December '99 and January '00 in <a href="http://www.begroovy.com">BeGroovy</a>. They both deal with <i>Graphical User Interface</i> building using <i>Squirrel</i>. If you're interested in GUI, you will need to read the <i>GUI Manual.pdf</i> PDF file (there's no HTML version available for now).
<p>
<i>Squirrel</i> is shipped with two executables that you will be using to run your programs as well as the demos privided with the release:
<p>

is also the <i>Squirrel</i> interpreter but with a console

In case you don't want to keep <i>Squirrel</i>, executing the following program will remove it from your computer:

<b>2. Running the Demos</b>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
The folder <i>Demos</i> contains severals demonstration scripts. Each of these is reconized as a <i>Squirrel</i> script file by it MIME type: <tt>text/x-script.squirrel</tt>. Now, to run a file we could :

<ul>
<li>use a Terminal to execute it like any other executable
<li>load it from the <i>Squirrel</i> console
<li>set the preferred application to <i>Squirrel</i>
</ul>

Setting <i>Squirrel</i> as the <i>Preferred Application</i> is the simplest and faster way to run a script file. This may, of course, vary from each script.
<p>
For example, if we consider the file <i>GUI Demo.sqi</i>, once the <i>Preferred Application</i> has been set to  <i>Squirrel.dr4.7</i>, a double click on the script's icon will launch it like any other application:
<P>
<center>
<img src="./images/filetype.gif" width=291 height=349 alt="filetype">
</center>
<P>
Now when we double click on the icon, <i>Squirrel</i> starts to execute the script:
<p>
<center>
<img src="./images/guidemo.gif" width=237 height=294 alt="guidemo">
</center>
</p>
Using <i>Squirrel.dr4.7</i> is fine when the script to execute has a <i>Graphical User Interface</i>. When the script don't have one, nothing will appear, and that's where the second executable <i>Squirrel's Console.dr4.7</i> came into play.<p>

For example, the demo file : <i>Fibonacci threading.sqi</i> which is a very simple demo of multi-threading in <i>Squirrel</i>, need to be used with <i>Squirrel's Console.dr4.7</i> as the <i>Preferred Application</i>. And then double clicking on it icon will give:
<p>
<center>
<img src="./images/fibodemo.gif" width=486 height=279 alt="fibodemo"> 
</center>
<p>
Of course it's possible to run <i>GUI Demo.sqi</i> from within the <i>Squirrel's Console.dr4.7</i> as well.

<b>3. The console</b>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
As we have seen earlier, launching <i>Squirrel's Console.dr4.7</i> start <i>Squirrel</i> with a console, but what is a console ? What is it good for ?<p>

The console act the same way as the <font color=blue>B</font><font color=red>e</font>OS Terminal, or any other Unix-like (or Dos-like) terminal. It display a prompt, waits for the user's inputs and then processes the command. It's useful for those who want to discover <i>Squirrel</i> interactively, by submitting orders and then observing the results.
<P>
The <i>Squirrel</i>'s console also allow you also to load and execute scripts like the demos by the menu <i>Script</i>. Some settings can also be changed.

<b>4. Writing and running your own script</b>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
Want to create your first <i>Squirrel</i> script ? Easy! What do you need ?

<ul>
<li>an idea :)
<li>a text file editor
<li>a <i>Squirrel</i> interpreter of course :)
</ul>

The choice of the text editor is up to you. By default, <font color=blue>B</font><font color=red>e</font>OS is shipped with <tt>StyledEdit</tt> and of course the famous (and infamous) <tt>vi</tt>. Personnaly, I use (and prefer) <tt>Pe</tt>, but that's a matter of personal tast (even if Pe is great :).
<p>
Obviously, you need to have an idea.Â  Even a rough idea would help before having to face the blank text editor window :) 
<p>
So, let's suppose that your first script will ask the user name and then displays a welcome message. We will use <tt>StyledEdit</tt> to create a new file to insert the code as if it was a common text file:
<p>
<center>
<img src="./images/stylededit.gif" width=365 height=140 alt="stylededit">
</center>
</p>
After saving the new text file under the name <i>welcome.sqi</i>, we have to set is <i>MIME type</i> and <i>Preferred Application</i> using the <tt>File Type</tt> application. You will need to run it twice (due to what looks like a <font color=blue>B</font><font color=red>e</font>OS bug). The first time to set the MIME type and the second time to select from the <i>Preferred Application</i> list <i>Squirrel's Console.dr4.7</i>. The icon of the file will then looks like :
<p>
<center>
<img src="./images/welcome.gif" width=60 height=50 alt="welcome">
</center>
<p>
Double clicking on it will execute the script file we just created:
<p>

<b>5. <i>Squirrel</i> scripts like shell scripts</b>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
You may want to execute a <i>Squirrel</i> script like any shell script or any other executable from the <font color=blue>B</font><font color=red>e</font>OS Terminal.
<p>
It's easy to execute it like that. You just have to add to the first line of your script :
<p>
<tt>#!/boot/apps/Squirrel/Squirrel.dr4.7</tt>
<P>
Of course, you could have also used <i>Squirrel's Console.dr4.7</i> to execute your script file in the <i>Squirrel</i>'s console rather than the terminal.
<p>
Inputs and outputs occur then through the <font color=blue>B</font><font color=red>e</font>OS Terminal.

<p>
<i>Squirrel</i> is a recent scripting language, and as the result of the present lack of users, <i>Squirrel</i> does not have web sites where to get help or tutorials. Until <i>Squirrel</i> becomes more popular, feel free to drop me an email concerning any questions or comments you may have. I will be more than happy to get you started with <i>Squirrel</i>.
