=========
Squirrel is a scripting language like Perl, Python or Tcl, but on
the contrary of those languages, which are all available on BeOS
among other, Squirrel has been designed for BeOS and it is only
available for it.

Squirrel is a "Logo Dialect". Don't get me wrong, Squirrel is NOT
a programming language for kids ! Altought it is convenient
and well adapted for school use, as any Logo dialect is, I tried 
to adapt Squirrel to fit beginner and veterans programmers
needs.

The major strength of Squirrel is it easy access to some of the
BeOS keys features such as :

* File attributes (Read/Write attributes)
* Multi-Threading (Create/suspend/synchronize threads)
* Mailing ability (Build and send an email from your script)
* Graphical User Interface building (with Font sensitivite and
automatic placement)

Squirrel comes with severals Add-On providing primitives (built-in 
procedures) for you to use :

* Input/Output (console)
* Data processing (list, string)
* Data structures (Dictionary, Vector)
* Execution in background of external application
* Maths functions
